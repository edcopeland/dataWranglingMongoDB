This exercise is from the udacity data wrangling with mongodb course.  The objective is to extract airport
data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Data_Elements.aspx?Data=2). 

The dataWrangling procedure for achieving this is as follows :

1 - Build a list of Carrier values
2 - Build a list of Airport values
3 - Make a HTTP Request to download all of the data as seperate html files
4 - Parse the datafiles to store the data in json format
